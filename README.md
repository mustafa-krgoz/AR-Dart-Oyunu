# AR Dart Game Development

  This project involved the creation of an augmented reality (AR) dart game utilizing Unity and AR
Foundation, featuring two 3D models: a dartboard and a dart. The game offers an interactive experience
where players can throw virtual darts at a dartboard. Successful hits dynamically increase the player's
score, providing real-time feedback and fostering an immersive gaming experience.

  The game utilizes both plane detection and image target technology, providing flexibility and compatibility across various augmented reality environments. Plane detection allows the dartboard to be positioned on real-world surfaces like tables or floors, while image target enables the dartboard to appear when a specific image is scanned. This dual approach ensures that the game can be played in a variety of settings, offering users an adaptable and engaging AR experience.

## Features
- Plane Detection: The game uses AR Foundation's plane detection feature to place the dartboard on real-world surfaces like tables or floors.
- Image Target Technology: The game is also compatible with image target recognition, allowing the dartboard to appear when a specific image is scanned.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players can throw virtual darts and receive real-time feedback on their performance, enhancing the immersive experience.
- 3D Models: The game incorporates custom 3D models for both the dartboard and the dart, adding a realistic touch to the AR environment.
- Score System: The game features a dynamic score system where the player's score increases with each successful dart throw.
- Distance Display: The game shows the distance between the camera (player) and the dartboard, adding context to the player's position in the AR environment.

## Dependencies
- Unity: The game is developed using Unity for creating the AR experience.
- AR Foundation: Unity's AR Foundation is used for handling augmented reality features like plane detection and image tracking.
- C#: Scripts are written in C# to control the game's logic, such as dart throwing and scoring.

## Getting Started
  To run this project, you need Unity with AR Foundation support installed. Follow these steps to set up and run the game:
- Clone the repository or download the project files.
- Open the project in Unity.
- Ensure that the necessary AR packages are imported, such as AR Foundation, ARCore (for Android), or ARKit (for iOS).
- Download and install any required libraries and dependencies through the Unity Package Manager.
- Build the project to your target platform (Android or iOS).
- Deploy the application to your mobile device and start playing the game.
